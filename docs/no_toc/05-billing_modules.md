## Create Google Billing Account

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using your Google ID. **Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra.**  

1. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven't been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to "Try for Free."

1. Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. 

1. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your team members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don't worry! **You won't be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing**.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_146.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Billing Account Setup, with &quot;Individual Account&quot; highlighted.  Also highlighted is text stating &quot;You won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.&quot;" alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Billing Account Setup, with &quot;Individual Account&quot; highlighted.  Also highlighted is text stating &quot;You won't be charged unless you manually upgrade to a paid account.&quot;" width="100%" />

1. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going directly to the billing console [console.cloud.google.com/billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) 

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_293.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console dropdown menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console dropdown menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." width="100%" />

1. Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1tGpzZaQxoTAcxs_nyyNL2FOqypjEofEnMVpBtZiAw4A_g116ca06e27d_0_437.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console Billing Page, with the name of the new billing account highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console Billing Page, with the name of the new billing account highlighted." width="100%" />

At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the **Create Account** button.  We generally recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source.

## Add Terra to Google Billing Account

## View Spend for Google Billing

:::: {.borrowed_chunk}

You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember

- There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost
- Costs are reported at the level of Workspaces, so if there are multiple people using a Workspace, you will not be able to determine which of them was responsible for the charges.

The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account.  To view spending:
  
1. Log in to the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/) console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects.

1. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing).

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_144.png" title="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of the Google Cloud Console drop-down menu, with &quot;Billing&quot; highlighted." width="100%" />

1. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking "Manage Billing Accounts" from the drop-down menu.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_295.png" title="Screenshot of an individual Google Cloud Billing Account with the drop-down menu item &quot;Manage Billing Accounts&quot; highlighted." alt="Screenshot of an individual Google Cloud Billing Account with the drop-down menu item &quot;Manage Billing Accounts&quot; highlighted." width="100%" />

1. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view.

    <img src="05-billing_modules_files/figure-html//1Ofs1As7XZWmxnaBOZvNYzAiuuaYgn1ce700eHyCNg2Y_g115e284bdc2_0_150.png" title="Screenshot of Google Cloud Billing Accounts Overview. A Billing Account name is highlighted." alt="Screenshot of Google Cloud Billing Accounts Overview. A Billing Account name is highlighted." width="100%" />

1. Look at the top of the **Overview** tab to see your month-to-date spending.

1. Click on the **Reports** tab to see more detailed information about each of your projects.  This is probably the most useful tab for exploring costs of individual projects over time.

1. Enter the email address of the user or group you’d like to add the the Billing Project.
    - If adding an individual, make sure to enter the account that they use to access AnVIL.
    - If adding a Terra Group, use the Group email address, which can be found on the Terra Group management page.

1. If this user or group will need to add and remove other users of the Billing Project, check the Owner box.  Otherwise leave it unchecked.
    - It’s often a good idea to have at least one other Owner of a Billing Project in order to avoid getting locked out, in case the original owner leaves or loses access to their account.

1.  You should now see the user or group listed in the Billing Project members, along with the appropriate role.  They should now be able to use the Billing Project to fund work on AnVIL.

## Disable Terra Billing Project

By default this module includes a warning to make sure people understand they will lose access to their Workspace buckets. You can remove the warning from this module by setting `AnVIL_module_settings$warning` to `FALSE` before running `cow::borrow_chapter`:

```
AnVIL_module_settings <- list(
  warning = FALSE
)
cow::borrow_chapter(
  doc_path = "child/_child_terra_billing_project_disable.Rmd",
  repo_name = "jhudsl/AnVIL_Template"
)
```

:::{.warning}
**Disabling a Billing Project makes Workspace contents inaccessible!**

Disabling a Billing Project disables funding to all Workspaces funded by the Billing Project.  You will be unable to compute in these Workspaces, and **you will lose access to any data stored in the Workspace buckets**.  It is sometimes possible to restore access by reactivating billing, but Google makes no promises about whether or how long the data will be recoverable.  

**Make sure everyone with Workspaces funded by the Billing Project has saved anything they want to keep in another location** before disabling the Billing Project.

To disable a Terra Billing Project (i.e. remove the Google Billing Account that funds the Terra Billing Project):

If necessary, you can restore funding to the Billing Project and associated Workspaces by clicking the teardrop icon and selecting "Change Billing Account".  However, Google makes no promises about how long the Workspace contents will remain available after you disable funding, so it is best not to rely on them.
